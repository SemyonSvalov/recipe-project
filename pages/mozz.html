<center><h3>The favorite stick shaped snack of a true sigma!(Well maybe there is another thing...UwU)</h3></center>

<p><h4>Ingredients!!!</h4></p>

<ul>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>2 cups of "milk"</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups of bread crumbs</li>
    <li>10 egg roll wrappers</li>
    <li>10 mozzarella string cheese sticks</li>
    <li>Olive oil for frying</li>
</ul>

<p><h4>Instructions!</h4></p>

<ol>
    <li>Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl. Whisk in the milk, then set aside. Place the bread crumbs into a plastic bag, and set aside.</li>
    <li>Separate and place an egg roll wrapper onto your work surface with one of the tips pointed towards you. Moisten the two far edges of the wrapper with water. Place a string cheese stick onto the corner nearest you, and roll it in 1/3 of the way, fold over the right and left corners, then continue rolling to the end, pressing to seal. Repeat with the remaining string cheese sticks and egg roll wrappers.    </li>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Dip the mozzarella sticks into the egg wash, then toss in the bread crumbs. Cook in batches in the hot oil until crisp and golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
